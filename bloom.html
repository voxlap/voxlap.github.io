								<h2 class="major" style="overflow: hidden;">What Could Be Improved</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>A lack of clear documentation guidelines and requirements led to decentralized

									<li>Lack of code reviews led to buggy code making it into production</li>
									<li>Small amount of time for pre-production meant many mechanics were not designed

						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Game Prototyping &amp; Pitching</h1>
						<h2>Bloom: Tome of Power</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Game Pitching</h1>
						<h2>In WolverineSoft Studio, the 30-40 person student run game studio / club I help to run at
							the University of Michigan, each semester we have students pitch a game idea that they would
							like the team to create. We give a template with various questions for people to answer, and
							they fill it out and submit their ideas. </h2>
						<h2>We tend to pick game pitches that we feel are scoped low enough that they can be created
							within our typical 3 month development cycle, and that best fit our team, which has a high
							number of 2D artists, a low number of 3D artists, and only 1-2 writers. To that end, this
							past summer, I pitched my first game idea, a <a
								href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1udXzAOk_EQSwkHPWvn4muFE_ql8GLpZ8Cx_Ie8i7oIM/edit?usp=sharing"><u>Roguelite
									Retro First Person Shooter</u></a>. </h2>
						<h2>This game was intended to give our overwhelmingly programmer oriented team enough systems to
							expand on, our 2D artists work to do in animating billboarded enemy sprites, and those who
							wished to do 3D level design and artists who wanted to do 3D modeling a chance to shine.
						</h2>
						<h2>My pitch ended up being chosen as one of the two games we developed that summer, and
							although the roguelite elements were cut, the game was eventually <a
								href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/bloom-tome-of-power"><u>published on
									itch.io</u></a></h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Game Prototyping</h1>
						<h2>Something that helped bolster my pitch getting chosen, was the <a
								href="https://voxlap.itch.io/game-pitch"><u>prototype demo</u></a> (password: wsoft) I
							solo developed in little over a week in order to showcase my pitch’s potential using
							previous WolverineSoft studio art assets and code base (which were expanded upon by me in
							order to implement game specific features, along with several game specific scripts,
							prefabs, and art assets)</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Level Design</h1>
						<h2>Bloom: Tome of Power</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Level Design Team</h1>
						<h2>Once production began, I took on multiple roles. The majority of my time was taken up as the
							game’s Art Director, but I also spent a good amount of time attending game design team
							meetings, explaining my original pitch ideas to team members, giving input during
							playtesting post mortems, and also, working as a Principal Level Designer, leading a team of
							4 developers. </h2>
						<h2>As a principal level designer, I was tasked to lead my team in creating the 2nd level in the
							game, which would introduce the player to a spell that slowed down enemies inside of an Area
							of Effect bubble. </h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "><b>Planning</b></h1>
						<h2>Going into our greyboxing, we had 5 main goals for our level</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Introduce the player to a new spell</li>
							<li>Draw the player into the space</li>
							<li>Create a clear sightline to the end of the level from the start</li>
							<li>Allow players to take multiple intersecting paths through a village area</li>
							<li> Create a 2nd sightline back to the exit of the level near the end</li>
						</ul>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Part 1: Establishing a clear starting sightline</h1>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Version #1 </h1>
						<h2>Our initial blocking of the village valley had major issues from the start. While the player
							could see the end goal (the tower in the middle of the village), they couldn’t immediately
							see a path to reach that location</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Version #2</h1>
						<h2>Our second iteration was much closer to what we wanted. Moving away from the zigzagging
							paths of the original version, the valley was given a slope along the side where the
							entrance was located. This gave the player a natural idea of where to go, and adding in the
							wall with a gate served to guide the player towards our intended path through the space, and
							a way to naturally invite them into the area. Additionally, the raised section of the wall
							was added to help hide the fact that several enemies waited for the player on the other
							side.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Final Version</h1>
						<h2>Later in development, we found that it was best to place the new spell the player was
							supposed to try in this level directly into view from the start, so we added a room halfway
							up the central tower, and removed the hump in the wall that had been covering up enemies,
							which forced us to rework our enemy placements, but this ended up working in our favor as
							players were able to better familiarize themselves with the landscape before entering combat
						</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Part 2: Intersecting Paths</h1>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Version #1</h1>
						<h2>Our initial greybox had very few options for pathing, for the most part it was just a single
							path through the valley towards the cave entrance, with a slight zig zag to avoid the tower
							in the middle.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Version #2</h1>
						<h2>In our second iteration, in order to start having that feeling of intersecting paths and a
							more open arena area, we began designing 2 main paths through the level, yellow and blue,
							with red representing the critical path both converge on, and the couple of sections you
							could cross from one path to another being green

							Early on we placed the new spell for the player to try just inside of the gate a little over
							to the right in the purple circle. Having this right leaning placement meant more players
							took the right path, and so we were getting less feedback on the left side of the level</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Bloom Level Design</h1>
						<h2>As mentioned earlier, in the final design, we moved the new spell into a room in the central
							tower, which greatly impacted player pathing through the level. Players no longer favored
							the right side, and as we also added several spots to go back and forth between paths,
							players began moving between the two halves of the level much more freely. </h2>
						<h2>One issue that was still present though, was the weakness of the ground floor of the level.
							Much of the level had been designed with running around on the rooftops in mind. Several
							ramps were included to allow for the player to make it back up onto the roofs if they fell,
							but the experience of walking around on the ground itself was much too cramped. </h2>
						<h2>To fix this, we moved buildings around on left side to open up a path around the left on the
							ground, and we also opened up space between buildings throughout, even carving into the
							geometry in some places.

							In order to pay a bit of homage to classic retro FPS titles, and in order to add a small
							incentive for exploration, we added secret and hard to get to areas, noted with purple
							arrows, to the level. The one on the right is a classic walk through the wall to reveal a
							hidden hallway, and the one on the left was a hard to spot cave that required a difficult
							jump in order to access, and both housed weapons the player tried in the previous level</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Part 3: Establishing a clear ending sightline</h1>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Version #1
						</h1>
						<h2>In the initial version of the level, the end of level sightline was actually pretty good,
							even being well framed by the walls of the cave exit, but there was no place for the player
							to stand once exiting, and it didn’t make much sense that the cave ended so abruptly. We
							decided to move forward by adding in a platform for the player to stand on</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Final Version</h1>
						<h2>In the final version, the platform we added does slightly obstruct the view of the exit, but
							the player can still see, and often moved out onto the platform to assess the situation
							before jumping in to the last fight of the level.</h2>
						<h2>If I were to expand on the game in the future, I would have the platform break off when the
							player stands on it in order to force them into the arena!</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Final Level Design Result
						</h1>
						<p>While we weren’t able to solve every issue we had with our level during our short 3 month
							total development cycle over the summer, in the end I think my team succeeded in creating an
							enjoyable level that has a good amount of back and forth intersecting paths, clear
							sightlines, and an interesting layout. </p>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Systems Design &amp; Scripting</h1>
						<h2>Bloom: Tome of Power</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Weapon.cs</h1>
						<h2>Unity has a certain type of asset, a ScriptableObject, which can hold preset data and be
							used throughout code. It’s a very handy system that allows you to easily define several
							different types of objects without having to change any code in order to have those
							variations. </h2>
						<h2>For the Bloom FPS prototype, I elected to use SO’s to store data related to Weapons,
							including their name, what prefab object to spawn as their projectile, what color they
							should turn the spell VFX, and what image to use as their User Interface Icon. This made it
							very easy to create several new weapons, and allowed me to create 4 different weapons just
							for the proof of concept build!</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">WeaponManager.cs</h1>
						<h2>Here we have the weapon manager script I created for the prototype. This system was intended
							to make setup very easy, and mostly event oriented. </h2>
						<h2>The modularity of the functions plays into that significantly (we have AddWeapon,
							SetCurrentWeapon, HasWeapon, and so forth). This, along with the fact that all these
							functions are public, allows for easy callbacks through public Unity events that can be set
							through the inspector.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">AnimationEvents.cs</h1>
						<h2>While a very simple script, AnimationEvents.cs is something that I wrote once, and have been
							using all the time since then. I created it so that I could have a list of events to fire
							off and call whatever method I liked from a Unity Animation. I’ve been able to use it for
							everything: from making enemies stop moving when they attack, to playing sound effects, to
							creating a player dash.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Enemy Design #1</h1>
						<h2>Bloom: Tome of Power</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Spider Enemy Design</h1>
						<h2>Inspired by <i>Half Life</i>’s headcrab, this enemy is intended to run out from the shadows,
							scare the player by jumping up towards their face, and then scurrying off into the darkness
							to hide, before repeating the process all over again. They were intended to force the player
							to explore the map, and the hiding spots were often placed next to key items or pickups in
							order to reward the player if they decided to give chase.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Spider Enemy AI</h1>
						<h2>The spider AI script I wrote is rather simple. It runs towards the player, jumps up and
							attacks, then runs off to a random hiding location, and hides for HideTime seconds, before
							repeating it all over again.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Random Location Manager</h1>
						<h2>In order to make things a bit simpler (and in case we wanted to expand out to having several
							enemies that might try to run away from the player) I created a simple prefab &amp; script
							that have several hiding spot transforms as children that can be placed throughout the
							level. When an enemy AI requests it, it assigns them a random hiding spot that the enemy AI
							can then start moving towards.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Game Release Link:</h1>
						<h2><a
								href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/bloom-tome-of-power"><u>https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/bloom-tome-of-power</u></a>
						</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Enemy Design #2</h1>
						<h2>Forgotten Forest VR (Project WIP)</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Enemy Director AI Design</h1>
						<h2>Much more recently, I’ve been working on a Virtual Reality Action Horror FPS with a 6 person
							team. In this title, the player advances down a trail in a dark forest with creatures
							running out from the darkness to attack them. We wanted to have a 60-40 split between
							gunplay and horror/interaction moments, so for our MVP we decided to mainly focus on nailing
							the gunplay and enemy AI. </h2>
						<h2>As the player is going to be in a rather open forest, we wanted to make sure that they make
							progress towards the level exit. To that end, I started to design an Enemy Director AI off
							of the one used in <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, with rules that try to draw the player back onto the
							trails, and pressure them to keep advancing. </h2>
						<h2>Going off of this, we decided that, for at least the MVP, the enemies would behave similarly
							to zombies as well.</h2>
						<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Simple Zombie AI</h1>
						<h2>Using the animator, animation events, and my animation event interface script, I created a
							simple zombie AI. The animations each call a different animation event interface event,
							which is wired up to various methods, such as changing the move speed, telling the chase
							behavior whether or not it should chase, and playing sound effects. </h2>
						<h2>In combination with the animator state machine, and some simple colliders triggering
							animation parameters, we can have a fully animation event driven enemy AI, which allows for
							us to tweak movement speed, attack duration, and other complex AI behaviors without ever
							having to touch a line of code.</h2>
