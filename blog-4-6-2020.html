					<h3>The Perfect Swing</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackAnimator1.png">

					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackAnimator2.png">
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackAnimator3.png">
					<p>My goal this time around was to revamp the attack animations, and the way that the attack
						animator layer was setup. I got started by making 3 different blendtrees, one that had
						animations where the player stepped forward before attacking that were to be played when they
						were not moving and grounded, one that had animations that had no leg keyframes, and one set
						that also included a downward attack for when the player was in the air, and finally I have them
						all play a sword sheathing animation when the attack finishes</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/oldHorizAttack.gif">
					<p>For reference, here is the old horizontal attack, which is very stiff, and didn't well convey the
						attack direction</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/newHorizAttack.gif">
					<p>And here is the new.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/horizontalAttack3D.gif">
					<p>This new animation was created by moving the bones in 3D space so that I could try and overcome
						the stiffness that the 2D bone animations had caused in the old animations. This caused a bit of
						a paper type look, but I feel that the added readability it adds to the swing is a worthwhile
						payoff</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackUpLegs.gif">
					<p>Pictured here is the upward attack animated using this same 3D style</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackUpNoLegs.gif">
					<p>And a version of the same animation with no leg or hip keyframes</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/attackUp3D.gif">
					<p>And here's what it looked like in 3D</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/downAttack.gif">
					<p>Finally, here's the new downward attack, which uses a minimal amount of the 3D effect, as it was
						more inline with the 2D perspective</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/downAttack3D.gif">
					<p>That said, here's what it looks like in 3D</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/swordAway.gif">
					<p>Lastly, here's the aforementioned sheathing animation</p>
					<h3>Leaping to New Heights</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/jumpUp.gif">
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/fallDown.gif">
					<p>Next up, I wanted to revamp the player's jump and falling animations so they were more than just
						a single keyframe, so I added some rustling to the hair and Io's clothes</p>

					<h3>Life, Death, and Animations</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/deathAnimSwordBounce.gif">
					<p>Here we have my first attempt at a death animation, which continues off of Alyssa's OnHit
						animation. Originally I had hand animated the sword falling out of Io's hand, but realized that
						that wouldn't work if she were to die near the edge of the platform.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/swordBouncePhysics.png">
					<p>Upon realizing that my animation wasn't going to work as is, I turned to the studio server to ask
						if anyone had any ideas on how to pivot to using a physics driven sword</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/deathAnimNoSwordBounce.gif">
					<p>I didn't get a chance to enact any of that advice, so for now I just made the sword stay on her
						back when she dies</p>
					<h3>Giving the Scarf Some Weight</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/scarfDamperShowcase.gif">
					<p>Tackling a long standing greivance with the game, I finally added a way to damper the motion of
						the scarf!</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/scarfDamperInspector.png">
					<p>Here are the different settings for the different directions that the scarf movement could be
						dampered in</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/scarfDamperCode.png">
					<p>And here is the change that I added to the scarf code</p>
					<h2 class="major">Level Design Pod Work</h2>
					<h3>Fixing the Background</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/4-6-2020/fixedParallax.gif">
					<p>I spent several hours fixing the parallax script! I made it so it's locked vertically to the
						camera, fixed the jitter of the movement, and fixed the way the prefab was setup so the effect
						is more subtle</p>
