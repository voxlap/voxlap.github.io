					<h2 class="major">Player Pod Work</h2>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_rigging.png">
					<p>I was tasked with setting up the prefab for Io's view. This included making basic keyframes for
						most of the animations, and figuring out how to animate the scarf.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/animator.png">
					<p>I also setup the various parameters and transitions for Io's animator, as an example for the
						other animator's who will be working on animating her.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_fall.gif">
					<p>Here is one of the first and simplest animations I made for Io falling, which is just a single
						keyframe for now, and is blended into from the jumping up keyframe depending on Io's vertical
						velocity.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_idle.gif">
					<p>Next up is Io's idle animation. This is a bit over exaggerated at the moment, as I mainly wanted
						it to move so much while testing out the scarf physics</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_jump.gif">
					<p>Here is Io's jump animation. It's currently very short as the animations are not driving the
						motions, so I couldn't have too much anticipation</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_run.gif">
					<p>Here is Io's run animation. Of the animations I've completed thus far, the keyframes themselves
						are probably the closest to a final product, but it still needs extra polish, adding in the
						various principles of animation to bring it to a finalized state.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_slide.gif">
					<p>Here is Io's wall slide animation. For this animation, I made sure to flip the sprite
						horizontally in the animation, so that when you run into or fall into a wall, Io turns around to
						face away from it. This meant that I had to go back and add keyframes to all of the other
						animations so that her scale was getting rest.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/io_wall_jump.gif">
					<p>Next up is the wall jump. Similar to the normal jump, it's rather abrupt due to animations not
						driving any motions, and is by far the roughest of these animations, but should still serve as
						an okay starting point for the other animators to work off of.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/rigidbody_scarf.png">
					<p>Here we have a snippet from Unity's blog post on the Lost Crypt, their latest 2D features demo.
						This part specifically is talking about how they used rigidbody constraints to make the player's
						hair physics driven, which is a system I intended to copy for Io's scarf.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/rigidbody_scarf_mess.gif">
					<p>That... didn't end well. Something about having the rigidbodies be children of the bones utterly
						destroyed the scarf once the player began to move, and the problem greatly worsened when they
						switched directions.</p>

					<p>After many hours of trial and error trying to get the rigidbody driven scarf to work, I abandoned
						the approach and began looking for alternatives. I happened across this video tutorial, which
						explains how to use verlett integration to create 2D physics ropes using the line render, and
						followed along to create my own version. Basically, we give a starting point, and the script
						simulates the physics for a number of points in a rope separated a given length.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/scarf_prefab.png">
					<p>Once I knew how I was going to be setting up the scarf, one gameobject with the newly written
						verlett integration rope script and linerenderer for each portion of the scarf, I setup the
						prefab.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/scarf_piece_example.png">
					<p>I setup the linerenderer on each portion of the scarf to have a width curve that matched the
						artist's intended shape for that section, and set the color of the linerenderer to match.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/scarf_front.png">
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/scarf_back.png">
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/scarf_knot.png">
					<p>Pictured above are the different settings for each scarf piece which are setup to have the
						correct number of segments and distance between points so that they match their intended look.
					</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/verlet_scarf.gif">
					<p>Here is an gif of the final result. It's a bit too wavy / light for my taste, so my next steps
						will be to figure out how to add some more weight to the simulation.</p>

					<p>And finally, here's how it all looks together.</p>
