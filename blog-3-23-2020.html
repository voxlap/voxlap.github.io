					<h2 class="major">Review Work</h2>
					<h3 class="major">Giving Feedback & Critique:</h3>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/artIntroduction.png">
					<p>Over the past 3 weeks I have made the transition from being the Project Lead to being the art
						director. This change was mainly made as I was doing a lot of animation work and teaching
						animation to a lot of members, being asked to review art work, being asked to implement art work
						on the sprites, and this took up a large portion of my time, and as an art student, I found it
						to be more enjoyable work.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/boss1.png">
					<p>After this change was determined among the leads, I began to give the artists feedback on their
						in progress works in the art channels. Here, I was giving feedback about the Crystal caves boss
						animation.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/flower1.png">
					<p>Here I can be seen giving feedback to Naveen about his teleport recharge item in hopes of
						refining the design and making it more cohesive with the rest of the game's artwork </p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/flower2.png">
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/flower3.png">
					<p>Following my public feedback, Naveen messaged me a few more times asking for further advice as he
						began to iterate on the work</p>

					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/stalker.png">
					<p>Here I'm giving advice about one of the artist's enemy animations, in hopes that they could make
						the walk cycle a bit more natural.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/art-direction/stalwart1.png">
					<p>Here Naveen reached out to me asking for more feedback on one of his enemy sprite, and did again
						a few days later.</p>



					<h2 class="major">Player Pod Work</h2>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/attackCode.png">
					<p>Here is the code I wrote for triggering the player's attack animatioons</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/downAttack.gif">
					<p>Here is the first (down attack) of 3 different attack animations I did for the player. These
						needed to be rather quick so it didn't feel unresponsive, but still have enough anticipation and
						recovery time to feel believable.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/upAttack.gif">
					<p>Here is the up attack version</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/horizAttack.gif">
					<p>And finally the horizontal attack</p>

					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/newAnimator.png">
					<p>Next up, I reworked the entire animator and events that triggered the animations on the player to
						use bools rather than triggers in an attempt to cut back on the various bugs that we were having
						with the animator setup</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/newAnimEvents1.png">
					<p>Here you can see some of those new functions being called from the character controller events
					</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/newAnimEvents2.png">

					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/newIdle.gif">
					<p>Next up, I reworked the player's idle animation to be a bit more subtle after taking feedback
						from some members.</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/IoThrow.gif.gif">
					<p>Here is the projectile throw animation I made</p>
					<img class="left" style="width: 50%;" src="images/project_blue/player-pod/newIdle.gif">
					<p>And here is how I setup the attack animator. It's on another animator layer with a single
						blendtree triggered by entering from any state based on an animation trigger, and another state
						that it starts at by default with no motion. The layer is weighted at 1 and overrides any motion
						the upper body was doing for the lower layer animation in order to let the player attack while
						in any state.</p>
