					<h2>Lead Mid Sprint Retrospective</h2>
					<p>These past two weeks, the level design team has made a lot of good progress. I'd probably agree with other leads that at the start of this time, level design was probably the most worrying pod. Now, after some serious effort by our awesome programmers, I'd say that we're in a much better place. We made excellent progress on bug fixes, in no small part thanks to the decision to move more programming members over to the pod. At the start of the last 2 week period, some of the other leads had suggested cutting the level generator system entirely, but I felt that the level generator was at the core of the game's identity at the time, and that level design morale would take a major hit if it was cut, so I pushed back, being given a week to fix things. Lucky for us, we were able to fix all major bugs. Aside from programming, art has been coming along good, but struggling with members' lack of Unity knowledge, and end of semester fall off. I think for future semesters we'll need to force artists to do unity and git onboarding sooner. In other news, I personally have been taking on more art director responsibilities as development progressed, task creation and review, more leads and members reaching out to me regarding art decisions, and overall this has led to both level design pod and art direction suffering. I had signed up to be associate art director, a role intended to fill in gaps where necessary and only occasionally help the main art director, but somehow I've ended up doing more than I asked for. I think it might be for the best if in the future we don't have leads sign up for more than one position at a time, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
