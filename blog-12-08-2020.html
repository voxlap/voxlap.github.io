					<h2>Electric Art Direction</h2>
					<p>
						Overall, Circuitry was a wonderful project, and I'm super proud of the progress my art team was
						able to make. I was worried at first, we had a hard time finding a solid narrative base, and
						while we did want to pay homage, copying nuclear throne visually was something we wanted to
						avoid. In the end, I think we ended up with a pretty good result, and what I think might be one
						of the better looking and more complete studio games artistically.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I learned a lot about how narrative foundations can help to establish an art direction, how to
						refine our concept art and preproduction phases, as well as how to trust in my artists to take
						on additional tasks, and work together to get a really solid final product.

					</p>
					<br>
					<p>As for my future plans, I'm not entirely sure. I know that I want to pursue indie dev, and I
						have a team of around 6 studio alum working with me currently on a VR title, but beyond that,
						I'm not super sure. I've tried almost everything in gamedev through the studio and
						WolverineSoft, from programming, to art, to game design, to production. I've loved all of it for
						different reasons, and deciding on a single path is difficult. For now, I know that I want to
						try to get into the industry in some way, and I want to continue making games for as long as I'm
						still enjoying it as much as I am.
